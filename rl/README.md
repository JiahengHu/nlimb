# Reinforcement Learning Code

This is a fork of code I commonly use for experiments involving Reinforcement Learning. The up-to-date repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cbschaff/rl).

Some of the code in this folder is based on [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines).
